# Chain-Based Number Systems (CBNS)

This is an exploratory paper on **Chain-Based Number Systems**, a conceptual framework for creating alternative mathematical universes through symbolic chains of numbers.

## 🌐 Description
CBNS proposes a structure where numbers are arranged in custom "chains" rather than traditional lines or fields. Each chain can define its own arithmetic and rules of operation, potentially offering:

- Contextual arithmetic
- Safe expression of undefined values (e.g. 1/0)
- Unique symbolic spaces
- New computational/logical domains
